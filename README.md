My First Project in Odin on Recipes HTML

Description: In this project I will learn how to make a basic HTML webpage including links. I will also work on keeping files organized and using alts on images. I am not going to worry too much about style, but rather focus on functionality and specificity. 

Reflection: This project was just challenging enough for me at the time. I learned how to organize files through the terminal and was forced (in a good way) to debug my own errors. I was challenged by the open endedness of the project and felt supported by the previous content so I had lots to look back on and reference. Also shoutout to Google.
